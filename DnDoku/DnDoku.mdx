# DnDoku!!!

---
Inspired by PokeDoku, this project aims to create a version based on creatures from...
<div style={{backgroundColor: 'red'}}>
Dungeons & Dragons Fifth Edition
</div>

...utilizing arbitrary values from 5e including, but not limited to:
- Challenge Rating
- Number of Hit Dice
- Alignment
- Source
- Creature Type
- Creature Environment
- Ability Scores
- Spellcasting Level
- Size

### Pre-development Research Required:
- At least nine distinct traits for randomized matrix
- How to scrape DnDBeyond for stat blocks, building off tools designed to port content from DnDBeyond to other VTT programs
- Sourcing media for potential inputs (not all published creatures have official art)

Now what? I don't know how to do documentation. I just wanted to play with MDX.
