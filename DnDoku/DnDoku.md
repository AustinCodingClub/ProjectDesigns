Inspired by PokeDoku, this project aims to create a version based on creatures from Dungeons and Dragons Fifth Edition using sources like the Monster Manual, with a variable matrix using arbitrary values like:
- Challenge Rating
- Number of Hit Dice
- Alignment
- Published Source
- Creature Type
- Creature Environment
- Ability Scores
- Spellcasting Level
- Size

### Pre-development Requirements
- 12 distinct traits for randomized matrix
- API access or scraper for DnDBeyond
