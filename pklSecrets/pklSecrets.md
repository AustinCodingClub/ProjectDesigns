# Pkl Secrets (Project pklShh!)

## Introduction
This project is to create some sort of secret fetcher for Apple's pkl config language.
Since the pkl language is **BRAND NEW** we could be the first to create a useful tool for it.

pkl source code is basically java I think so we would need to create a PR for the pkl language to be able to use it in our project.
