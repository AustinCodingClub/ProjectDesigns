# Secret Manger (Project shhh!)

## Introduction
This project is to create a secret manager. The secret manager will allow a user to store and retrieve secrets. The secrets will be encrypted and stored in a database. The user will be able to create, read, update, and delete secrets. The user will also be able to share secrets with other users.
You should be able to read secrets from Azure Key Vault and AWS Secrets Manager as well as keep secrets in a local database.

## Brainstorm Ideas!!!
